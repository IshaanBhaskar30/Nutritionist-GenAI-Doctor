🥗 Calories Advisor App

🎯 Project Overview

The Calories Advisor App helps users analyze the nutritional content of their food by simply uploading a food image. Powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model, this application processes food images and provides detailed calorie counts, nutritional breakdowns, and insights into the overall healthiness of the meal. It works seamlessly to give users a clear understanding of the macronutrient distribution of their food.

🧰 Key Features

✅ Upload Food Images: Analyze your food items directly from images (JPG, PNG, JPEG).

🍽️ Calorie Breakdown: The app lists each food item along with its estimated calorie count.

🔍 Meal Health Analysis: Provides an overall evaluation of whether the meal is healthy or unhealthy.

📊 Nutritional Insights: Gives the nutritional breakdown in percentages (Carbohydrates, Fats, Fibers, Sugars, etc.).

🔐 Secure API Configuration: Enter your Google API key for using the Gemini model.
